# Data-bot

This the prototype code for the final version of the project "Databot". The idea behind the project was to create a hybrid of chatbot and data analysis software. The main motivation was the usage of "conversational-texts" which would then be analysed by the bot using the help of Natural Language Provcessing (NLP) to produce the required results.
The databot is first of its kind software which can perform several tasks of Excel, PowerBi or other such softwares without the user to actually know how to operate the steps. The initial version includes text based input, however future versions are expected to include voice inputs. 
The software has been modified further to include options for further graph plots (upto 20 different kinds), more mathemetical functions (upto 40 different kinds) and supoort for analyzing geospatial data.
The final software is licensed under company policies and hence cannot be made public. 
The name is derived from Chatbot and Data Analysis, hence Databot.
